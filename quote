Trump, who is campaigning for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination and is the current frontrunner, has maintained his innocence in the case.
CNN reported in March at least two dozen people, including Mar-a-Lago resort staff, had been subpoenaed to testify to a federal grand jury that is investigating Trump's handling of the classified documents. On Thursday, CNN reported that a plumber, a maid, a chauffeur and a woodworker are among the Mar-a-Lago staffers who may be called to testify against Trump.

Meanwhile, Eisen posted on X, formerly Twitter on Thursday, "Calling Trump's chauffeur, maid, & other MAL employees as witnesses is a smart move by Jack Smith. But they're not used to being on the standâ€”& the fmr president's lawyers won't pull any punches."
